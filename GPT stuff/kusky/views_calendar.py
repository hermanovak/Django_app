#Got it, thank you for the clarification. In that case, we can modify the QA tests page to include a calendar for the current month with each day being a clickable link. When the user clicks on a #particular day, they are taken to the appropriate daily, weekly, or monthly QA page based on the day clicked. This will ensure that the user is always performing QA tests for the current day.

#We can use a Django package called django-bootstrap-datepicker-plus to implement the calendar functionality. It provides a datepicker widget that can be easily integrated into Django forms.

#Here's an example of how the new QA tests page might look:

#User logs in and clicks on QA tests
#A calendar for the current month is displayed
#User clicks on a particular day on the calendar
#User is redirected to the appropriate daily, weekly, or monthly QA page based on the day clicked
#Here's some sample code that shows how to use the django-bootstrap-datepicker-plus package to display a calendar for the current month:

# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from datetime import datetime
from bootstrap_datepicker_plus import DatePickerInput

def qa_tests(request):
    # Get the current date
    today = datetime.today()

    # Get the first and last day of the current month
    first_day = today.replace(day=1)
    last_day = today.replace(day=28) + timedelta(days=4)
    last_day = last_day - timedelta(days=last_day.day)

    # Create a list of dates for the current month
    dates = []
    curr_day = first_day
    while curr_day <= last_day:
        dates.append(curr_day)
        curr_day += timedelta(days=1)

    # Create a dictionary of date links for the current month
    date_links = {}
    for date in dates:
        date_str = date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        date_links[date_str] = '/qa-tests/' + date_str + '/daily'

    # Render the template with the calendar and date links
    return render(request, 'qa_tests.html', {'date_links': date_links, 'datepicker': DatePickerInput()})
