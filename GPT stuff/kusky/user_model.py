#Finally, you would need to integrate the authentication system with your existing Flask codebase. 
#You would need to ensure that every action and value input is associated with the logged-in user's account. 
#You can use Django's built-in `User` model to represent users and associate actions with a particular user. 
#For example, to associate a blog post with a user, you would define a `ForeignKey` field in the blog post model that references the `User` model:

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    date_published = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

#This will ensure that every post is associated with a particular user, and you can use the user ID to filter posts by author.
#I hope this gives you a general idea of how to create a login page and integrate user authentication with your existing Flask codebase.
